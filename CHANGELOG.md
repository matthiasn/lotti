# [Unreleased]
### Added
- Sync maintenance now supports Labels in the manual definition sync flow:
  - Sync page → Sync Entities modal includes a "Labels" checkbox alongside Tags, Measurables,
    Categories, Dashboards, Habits, and AI Settings.
  - Each step reports per-step progress and totals; selections can be run together.
- tests(labels/ai):
  - Max-volume labels selection (500+) with performance and ordering checks
  - Prompt injection protection for label names
  - Conversation retry and interruption coverage for `assign_task_labels`
  - TaskLabelsWrapper toast + undo + rapid assignment behavior
  - LabelValidator validity/concurrency tests
  - Summary note test when labels exceed the prompt cap
- AI label assignment with function-calling (see PR #2365):
  - Prompt label injection (capped to 100, usage + alphabetical) with optional private filtering.
  - `assign_task_labels` tool (add-only) with max 5 labels per call.
  - Shared rate limiter (5-minute window) and shadow mode.
  - User feedback: SnackBar in Task Details listing assigned labels with Undo to remove them.
  - Event stream for UI notifications and comprehensive unit/feature tests.
- Settings header widget tests now cover multiple text scale factors (1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0) and common screen widths to guard layout across devices.
- Label chips now surface tooltips/long-press descriptions, Task label sheets show inline "Create
  label" CTAs, and the journal header includes a quick label filter row for active selections.
- Labels settings list displays usage counts sourced from a new `watchLabelUsageCounts` stream plus
  widget coverage for the editor sheet, list page, assignment sheet/wrapper, and filter chips.
- Added integration (`label_workflow_test.dart`), accessibility, repository edge-case, and
  performance tests (1k+ tasks + reconciliation benchmarks) for the labels system.
- AI prompt selection modal now visually highlights default automatic prompts with gold accent (border and icon background).
- Platform-aware AI prompt filtering automatically hides local-only models (Whisper, Ollama, Gemini 3N) on mobile platforms.
- Fallback logic ensures default automatic prompts gracefully switch to available alternatives when local-only models are filtered on mobile.
- Comprehensive test coverage added for platform filtering, isDefault prompt highlighting, and ModalCard border/animation behavior.
- Outbox: Pause processing while logged out and surface a one-time red toast ("Sync is not logged in") when sync is enabled but not authenticated. Prevents wasted retries and clarifies state to the user.

### Changed
- Sync (Matrix): Client stream is now signal-driven and always triggers a catch-up via
  `forceRescan(includeCatchUp=true)` with an in-flight guard to prevent overlaps. Timeline callbacks
  continue to schedule debounced live scans and fall back to `forceRescan()` on scheduling errors.
- Sync (Matrix): Documentation refreshed to reflect signal-driven ingestion and backlog completion
  behavior (`lib/features/sync/README.md`, `docs/sync/sync_summary.md`).
- feat(ai/labels): Append a summary note after the labels JSON in prompts when the
  number of available labels exceeds the cap, e.g. `(Note: showing 100 of 150 labels)`.
- Matrix Sync Stats page now uses the modern SettingsPageHeader with collapsing sliver layout and subtitle, aligning with the new settings header UX.
- Extracted header spacing and breakpoints into `lib/widgets/app_bar/settings_header_dimensions.dart` for maintainability and consistency.
- Settings header filter card now hugs the count summary by trimming the extra padding underneath it.
- Tasks and journal tabs now persist category filter selections independently, restoring their own state after app restart.
- Category filter storage migrated from shared `TASK_FILTERS` key to per-tab keys (`TASKS_CATEGORY_FILTERS` and `JOURNAL_CATEGORY_FILTERS`).
- Task status filters (Open, In Progress, Done, etc.) remain scoped exclusively to the tasks tab.
- AI prompt availability now respects platform capabilities, preventing confusion from unusable model options on mobile.

### Fixed
- Sync (Matrix): Catch-up now continues escalating snapshot size until it’s not full (or lookback
  cap reached), ensuring the entire backlog after the read marker is retrieved. This eliminates
  missing EntryLinks after offline windows and prevents gray boxes on return to online.
- Stabilized labels/task widget tests by awaiting `getIt.reset()`, providing scoped service mocks,
  and giving sheet/editor hosts real `MediaQuery` sizes so chips, toggles, and CTAs are tappable
  during automation.
- Waveform: show visualization for recordings longer than 3 minutes by removing the duration gate
  and introducing dynamic zoom scaling for long clips; updated tests and docs accordingly.

## [0.9.704] - 2025-10-24
### Added
- Comprehensive Fts5Db coverage with insert and search stream tests to guarantee new database behaviour.
- Added extensive database test coverage for purge flows, conversion utilities, sync outbox edge cases, logging safeguards, and settings persistence.

### Changed
- Retired the legacy Matrix sync V1 pipeline in favour of the stream-first implementation.

## [0.9.703] - 2025-10-24
### Added
- Timer indicator now auto-scrolls to the running entry when tapped from task details page.
- Task focus controller for managing scroll-to-entry intent across navigation events.

### Changed
- Expanded speech waveform coverage with scrubber interaction tests, painter edge cases, cache I/O failure guards, and path sanitisation scenarios.

### Fixed
- Stabilised waveform cache pruning tests by clearing mock interactions between scenarios.

## [0.9.702] - 2025-10-23
### Changed
- Matrix sync now tracks locally emitted Matrix event IDs in a shared sent-event registry, short-circuiting echo events during ingestion and recording suppression metrics to cut redundant network and database work.

## [0.9.701] - 2025-10-23
### Added
- Support Markdown divider insertion from the journal editor toolbar.

## [0.9.700] - 2025-10-23
### Changed
- Split the smart journal loader into dedicated `DescriptorDownloader` and `VectorClockValidator` components so caching, purging, and vector-clock logic are independently testable.

### Fixed
- Matrix V2 catch-up now advances markers after offline sessions by correcting journal update result semantics, eliminating false "missing base" retries, and trimming duplicate backlog processing.
- Matrix outbox refreshes journal JSON before enqueueing and Matrix sender re-syncs vector clocks with descriptor payloads, preventing stale checklist descriptors from being uploaded.
- Added a circuit breaker so stale descriptor downloads bail out after repeated refresh attempts instead of looping forever.
- Bumped patch version to 0.9.700+3390 to ship the sync catch-up contract fix without breaking APIs.

## [0.9.699] - 2025-10-22
### Changed
- Sync filter chips now hide non-informational zero badges, emphasise pending/error/unresolved totals with tinted badges, trim their height slightly, and keep empty-state cards constrained on the conflicts page.

## [0.9.698] - 2025-10-22
### Changed
- Audio player progress bar now matches the play/pause ring by using `ColorScheme.primary` for both the scrub fill and contrast-adjusted playhead, softens the playback card shadow, and removes the glow to avoid black playheads in high-contrast themes. Light mode swaps the gradient background for a flat surface tint to keep the card crisp.

## [0.9.697] - 2025-10-22
### Changed
- Speech audio playback card now ships with glassmorphism styling, streamlined controls, custom progress bar, and dedicated widget coverage for play/pause and speed interactions.

## [0.9.696] - 2025-10-21
### Changed
- Moved Matrix sync maintenance actions (delete sync database, re-sync definitions/messages) to the new Matrix Sync Maintenance page under Sync Settings.
- Sync Outbox and Sync Conflicts list pages now use modern cards with segmented filters, inline counts, and polished empty states via the shared sync list scaffold.
- Added dedicated widget tests for `ConflictListItem` and `SyncListScaffold` covering filters, semantics, and interaction paths.

### Fixed
- Matrix Stats `Last updated` label now stays stable when metrics payloads are unchanged, eliminating refresh jitter.
- Guarded sync list filters against invalid persisted enum indexes on conflicts/outbox pages to prevent `RangeError`.

## [0.9.695] - 2025-10-21
### Changed
- Matrix Stats now keeps per-type "Sent" counts stable while the page stays flicker-free on mobile and desktop.
- Read markers no longer spam `M_UNKNOWN` errors—local-only IDs are skipped and expected misses are logged once.

## [0.9.694] - 2025-10-21
### Changed
- Sync UX overhaul:
  - Promote Sync to a top-level Settings entry (hidden when Matrix sync flag is off)
  - Move Outbox Monitor under `/settings/sync/outbox` and remove redundant toggle
  - Surface Matrix Stats as a full page under `/settings/sync/stats` with improved loading state
  - Clean up Advanced: remove Matrix/Outbox/Conflicts tiles; keep Logs, Health Import (mobile), Maintenance, About
  - Route matching for Sync pages now uses exact path matching for robustness
  - Localize new user-facing strings (tile subtitles and error text)

## [0.9.693] - 2025-10-21
### Changed
