# Lotti Privacy Policy

Lotti allows you to collect potentially sensitive information about yourself, your life, your health, all on your own devices and without collecting the data in a centralized place. No data is shared with anyone, which is not even possible without collecting it in the first place.

Lotti is open-source software, which allows anyone to verify that the claims above are indeed accurate. The aim of the project is to make the collection of data in a private journal entirely private and trustworthy. Anyone is encouraged to suggest improvements and raise concerns about how data is stored and handled.

Multiple devices can be synced via a user-provided email account through which information is exchanged, with encryption where the key is exchanged by generating and scanning a QR code.

Currently, the data on device is not encrypted. This is supposed to change going forward. In any case, it is highly encouraged to encrypt your devices anyway.

For the related blog posts, Google Analytics is used. If you do not want to be tracked there, you will likely already have disabled tracking anyway.

When participating in beta testing via Apple's TestFlight, it is required to send an email to the author providing your Apple ID.
