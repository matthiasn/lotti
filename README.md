[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/matthiasn/lotti/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/matthiasn/lotti) [![Flutter Test](https://github.com/matthiasn/lotti/actions/workflows/flutter-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matthiasn/lotti/actions/workflows/flutter-test.yml)

**Your AI-powered context manager with complete privacy control**

Lotti is an open-source personal assistant that helps you capture, organize, and understand your work and life through AI-enhanced task management, audio recordings, and intelligent summaries‚Äîall while keeping your data entirely under your control.

## Why Lotti?

Most AI-powered tools require you to upload and store your personal data on their servers, creating privacy risks and vendor lock-in. Lotti takes a different approach:

- **Complete data ownership**: All your information stays on your devices unless you explicitly choose to use cloud-based inference‚Äîand even then, GDPR-compliant European providers with no-retention policies ensure your data isn't stored
- **Configurable AI providers per category**: Choose between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama (local), or any OpenAI-compatible provider on a per-category basis
- **Privacy-first design**: You control exactly what data gets shared with AI providers‚Äîonly for specific inference calls via your API keys
- **No vendor lock-in**: Your data remains portable and accessible, independent of any subscription

## Core Features

*Currently, Lotti's AI capabilities are focused on task management and productivity. Habit tracking is fully functional but will receive AI enhancements in future updates.*

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Intelligence

- **Smart Summaries**: Automatically generate summaries of tasks, capturing key points and progress
- **Audio Transcription**: Transcribe recordings using either local Whisper (OpenAI's open weights model, 99 languages supported) or cloud providers with audio capabilities like Gemini Flash/Pro
- **Context Recovery**: Get back into flow quickly with AI-generated context when returning to tasks
- **Intelligent Checklists**: Transform rambling audio notes into actionable checklists
- **Chat with Your Data**: Ask questions about your tasks, learnings, and achievements across any time period

### üìù Comprehensive Tracking

- **Tasks**: Full lifecycle management (open, groomed, in progress, blocked, done, rejected)
- **Audio Recording**: Capture thoughts, progress notes, and brain dumps
- **Time Tracking**: Record time spent on tasks and projects
- **Journal Entries**: Written reflections and documentation
- **Habits**: Define and monitor daily habits and routines
- **Health Data**: Import from Apple Health and other sources
- **Custom Metrics**: Track anything that matters to you

### üîê Privacy & Control

- **Local-Only Storage**: All data is permanently stored only on your devices and never in the cloud
- **Encrypted Sync**: End-to-end encrypted synchronization between your devices (desktop/laptop and mobile) using **[matrix](https://matrix.org)**
- **Selective AI Usage**: Configure AI providers per category‚Äîkeep sensitive data completely local with Ollama but use state-of-the-art cloud models when appropriate
- **Your API Keys**: When you choose cloud AI, data is shared only for that specific inference call. Please review the respective provider's terms and privacy policy to understand how they handle your data
- **GDPR-Compliant Options**: European-hosted AI providers with no data retention policies available for enhanced privacy
- **Future-Proof**: Designed for the era when local AI inference becomes standard 

## AI Provider Configuration

Lotti supports multiple AI providers, configurable per category:

- **Cloud Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- **Local Inference**: Ollama for complete privacy (requires capable hardware)
  - Full functionality available with local models like Qwen3 (8B), GPT-OSS (20B/120B), Gemma3 (12B/27B)
  - Combined with local Whisper for speech recognition, enables 100% offline AI capabilities
- **OpenAI-Compatible**: Any provider with OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **European Options**: GDPR-compliant hosted alternatives

Configure different providers for different aspects of your life‚Äîuse cutting-edge models for work projects while keeping personal reflections completely private with local inference. With sufficient hardware, you can run everything locally without any cloud dependency.
