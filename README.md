## Why Lotti?

Most AI-powered tools require you to upload and store your personal data on their servers, creating privacy risks and vendor lock-in. Lotti takes a different approach:

- **Complete data ownership**: Your information stays on your devices. When you opt into cloud inference, European‚Äëhosted, no‚Äëretention providers are available
- **Configurable AI providers per category**: Choose between OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama (local), or any OpenAI-compatible provider on a per-category basis
- **Privacy-first design**: You control exactly what data gets shared with AI providers‚Äîonly for specific inference calls via your API keys
- **No vendor lock-in**: Your data remains portable and accessible, independent of any subscription

### Example Use Cases

- Pick up a task from last week ‚Äî see your last notes, time spent, and a one‚Äëparagraph recap
- Record a quick voice note ‚Äî later it‚Äôs transcribed and turned into a checklist
- Ask ‚ÄúWhat did I finish in June?‚Äù ‚Äî get a dated list with brief summaries

## Core Features

*Currently, Lotti's AI capabilities are focused on task management and productivity. Habit tracking is fully functional but will receive AI enhancements in future updates.*

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Intelligence

- **Smart Summaries**: Automatically generate summaries of tasks, capturing key points and progress
- **Audio Transcription**: Transcribe recordings using either local Whisper (OpenAI's open weights model, 99 languages supported) or cloud providers with audio capabilities like Gemini Flash/Pro
- **Context Recap**: Resume a task with a one‚Äëscreen recap of your latest notes, time, and progress
- **Intelligent Checklists**: Transform rambling audio notes into actionable checklists
- **Chat with Your Data**: Ask questions about your tasks, learnings, and achievements across any time period

### üìù Comprehensive Tracking

- **Tasks**: Full lifecycle management (open, groomed, in progress, blocked, done, rejected)
- **Audio Recording**: Capture thoughts, progress notes, and brain dumps
- **Time Tracking**: Record time spent on tasks and projects
- **Journal Entries**: Written reflections and documentation
- **Habits**: Define and monitor daily habits and routines
- **Health Data**: Import from Apple Health and other sources
- **Custom Metrics**: Track anything that matters to you

### üîê Privacy & Control

- **Local-Only Storage**: All data is permanently stored only on your devices and never in the cloud
- **Encrypted Sync**: End-to-end encrypted synchronization between your devices (desktop/laptop and mobile) using **[Matrix](https://matrix.org)** (requires a Matrix account ‚Äî self-hosted or public homeserver)
- **Selective AI Usage**: Configure AI providers per category‚Äîkeep sensitive data completely local with Ollama but use state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart (frontier) cloud models when appropriate
- **Your API Keys**: When you choose cloud AI, data is shared only for that specific inference call. Please review the respective provider's terms and privacy policy to understand how they handle your data
- **GDPR-Compliant Options**: European-hosted AI providers with no data retention policies available for enhanced privacy
- **Built for on‚Äëdevice**: Designed for the era when local AI inference becomes standard 

## AI Provider Configuration

Lotti supports multiple AI providers, configurable per category:

- **Cloud Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
- **Local Inference**: Ollama for complete privacy (requires capable hardware)
  - Full functionality available with local models like Qwen3 (8B), GPT-OSS (20B/120B), Gemma3 (12B/27B)
  - Combined with local Whisper for speech recognition, enables 100% offline AI capabilities
- **OpenAI-Compatible**: Any provider with OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **European Options**: GDPR-compliant hosted alternatives

Configure different providers for different aspects of your life‚Äîuse cutting-edge models for work projects while keeping personal reflections completely private with local inference. With sufficient hardware, you can run everything locally without any cloud dependency.

## Getting Started

### Installation

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for setup and development workflow.

### Beta Testing

- **Build it yourself**: for iOS, macOS, Android, Linux, Windows
- **iOS/macOS**: TestFlight builds are available for select users, will be available more broadly in due course
- **Linux**: See `tar.gz` files on **[GitHub releases](https://github.com/matthiasn/lotti/releases)** - will also be available via Flatpak soon

### Development

- Install Flutter ([instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)) ‚Äî FVM recommended; repo includes `.fvmrc`
- Install dependencies: `make deps`
- **Linux only**: Install emoji font support for proper emoji rendering:
  ```bash
  ./linux/install_emoji_fonts.sh
  ```
- Static analysis: `make analyze`
- Tests: `make test` ‚Ä¢ Coverage report: `make coverage`
- Code generation: `make build_runner` ‚Ä¢ Localization: `make l10n`
- Run locally: macOS `fvm flutter run -d macos` ‚Ä¢ others `flutter run -d <device>`
