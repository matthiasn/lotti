# Riverpod 3 Migration Progress (as of 2025-09-21)

## Research & Discovery
- Gathered official Riverpod 3 migration documentation (3.0 migration guide, notifier changes, whats-new overview) via Context7.
- Catalogued repository usage patterns: StateNotifier implementations, generated `@riverpod` families, `ref.listen`/`invalidate` usage, ProviderScope overrides, and dependency injection touchpoints.
- Identified current dependency set (flutter_riverpod ^2.4.9, riverpod ^2.6.1, riverpod_annotation ^2.3.5, riverpod_generator ^2.4.0, riverpod_lint ^2.3.10) and noted primary areas impacted by 3.0.

## Trial Migration Work
- Converted `ActionItemSuggestionsController` (`lib/features/sync/state/action_item_suggestions_controller.dart`) from `StateNotifier` to the new `Notifier` API while keeping Riverpod 2.x versions, validating feasibility of incremental migration.
- Updated the corresponding provider to `NotifierProvider` and shifted dependency acquisition into `build()` via `getIt`.
- Checked dependent widget usage to ensure compatibility with the new provider signature (awaiting regenerated code before running targeted tests).

## Migration Checklist
- [x] `lib/features/sync/state/action_item_suggestions_controller.dart`
- [ ] `lib/features/categories/state/categories_list_controller.dart`
- [ ] `lib/features/categories/state/category_details_controller.dart`
- [ ] `lib/features/ai_chat/ui/controllers/chat_recorder_controller.dart`
- [x] `lib/features/sync/state/fts5_controller.dart`
- [ ] `lib/features/sync/state/purge_controller.dart`
- [ ] `lib/features/sync/state/sync_maintenance_controller.dart`

## Documentation & Planning
- Authored implementation plan (`docs/implementation_plans/2025-09-21_riverpod_3_upgrade.md`) outlining phased upgrade strategy, risks, testing, and open questions.
- Coordinated next steps with emphasis on running build_runner post-dependency bump and expanding Notifier conversions feature-by-feature.

## Pending Actions
- Regenerate affected `.g.dart` files (awaiting build_runner run after broader migrations).
- Execute targeted tests for the updated controller once code generation completes.
- Proceed with dependency upgrades and remaining provider migrations per the implementation plan.

## Latest Runs
- build_runner (user)
- test/features/sync/state/fts5_controller_test.dart
- test/features/sync/ui/fts5_recreate_modal_test.dart
