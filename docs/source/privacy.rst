Privacy
=======

No fine print
-------------

With **meins**, it is straightforward. **Your data stays with you**. Meins does **not share of any of your data with anyone**. I strongly believe that everybody should be able to gather data about their lives themselves – without having to **donate** said data to Silicon Valley, or anyone else.

Meins might at some point give you a way to actively share data with others, but there will **not ever be any sharing of anything with anyone without your consent**, and only ever at your explicit command. That’s all. **No fine print, and you can verify all this in the [source code](https://github.com/matthiasn/meins)**. You have no reason to trust my word (or anyone's) when it comes to your private data.


Private Mode
------------

Now, I need to use **meins** in the presence of other people, for example at work, and not everything I record in meins is compatible with that. For this purpose, there is the private mode, which hides everything you would not want to show. More about that later.
