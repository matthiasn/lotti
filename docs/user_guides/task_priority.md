# Tasks: Priority (P0–P3)

Task Priority helps you focus on what matters most by giving every task a clear urgency level. Priorities use compact Linear‑style short codes that keep the UI tidy while remaining easy to scan.

- P0 — Urgent (ASAP)
- P1 — High (Soon)
- P2 — Medium (Default)
- P3 — Low (Whenever)

## Set a task’s priority
- Open a task’s detail view.
- In the header, tap the Priority chip.
- Choose one of P0–P3. The picker shows the short code plus a description (e.g., “Urgent (ASAP)”).
- The chip updates immediately; color indicates urgency (P0 red, P1 orange, P2 blue, P3 grey).

Tip: Existing/legacy tasks default to P2 (Medium) so nothing gets “lost” as unprioritized.

## Filter by priority
- Go to the Tasks tab.
- Tap the filter icon (top right).
- In the Priority section, tap one or more of P0…P3 to filter the list.
- Tap “All” to clear the selection and show all priorities again.

## How tasks are ordered
The task list sorts by:
1) Priority rank (P0 → P3)
2) Then by creation date (newer first): `date_from DESC`

This makes urgent tasks float to the top, with the newest urgent work first. (Due‑date sorting can be layered on later; for now creation date is the tie‑breaker.)

## Why short codes?
- Compact chips (P0–P3) keep cards readable, especially in dense lists.
- The selector spells out meanings to reduce ambiguity.

## Color scheme
- P0: red
- P1: orange
- P2: blue
- P3: grey

Colors adapt to light/dark themes for readability.

## Quick tips
- Use P0 sparingly; it should mean “do next.”
- Combine category + priority filters to focus by area and urgency.
- Start daily triage by setting priorities, then work top‑down.
