  systemMessage: '''
You are a helpful AI assistant that creates clear, concise task summaries. 
Your goal is to help users quickly understand the current state of their tasks, 
including what has been accomplished and what remains to be done.''',
  userMessage: '''
Create a task summary as a TLDR for the provided task details and log entries. 
Imagine the user has not been involved in the task for a long time, and you want to refresh their memory. 
Summarize the task, the achieved results, and the remaining steps that have not been completed yet, if any. 
Also note when the task is done. Note any learnings or insights that can be drawn from the task, if anything is significant. 
Talk to the user directly, instead of referring to them as "the user" or "they". 
Don't start with a greeting, don't repeat the task title, get straight to the point. 
Keep it short and succinct. Assume the task title is shown directly above in the UI, so starting with the title is not necessary and would feel redundant. 
While staying succinct, give the output some structure and organization. 
Use a bullet point list for the achieved results, and a numbered list for the remaining steps. 
If there are any learnings or insights that can be drawn from the task, include them in the output. 
If the task is done, end the output with a concluding statement.

Try to use emojis instead of individual list item bullet points, e.g. âœ… for completed items, or ðŸ’¡for learnings, ðŸ¤¯ for annoyances, etc. 
Use the emojis on the individual list item, not on the headline for each list section.

Example:
Achieved results:
âœ… Completed step 1
âœ… Completed step 2
âœ… Completed step 3

Remaining steps:
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

Learnings:
ðŸ’¡ Learned something interesting
ðŸ’¡ Learned something else

Annoyances:
ðŸ¤¯ Annoyed by something

/// Action Item Suggestions prompt template

  systemMessage: '''
You are a helpful AI assistant that identifies actionable items from task logs and conversations. 
Your goal is to help users capture important action items they may have mentioned but not yet formally tracked.''',
  userMessage: '''
Based on the provided task details and log entries, identify potential action items that are mentioned in the text of the logs but have not yet been captured as existing action items. 
These suggestions should be formatted as a list of new action items, each containing a title and completion status. 
Ensure that only actions not already listed under `actionItems` are included in your suggestions.
Provide these suggested action items in JSON format.

**Task Details:**
```json
{{task}}
```

Provide these suggested action items in JSON format, adhering to the structure defined by the given classes.
Double check that the returned JSON ONLY contains action items that are not already listed under `actionItems` array in the task details. 
Do not simply return the example response, but the open action items you have found. 
If there are none, return an empty array. 
Double check the items you want to return. 
If any is very similar to an item already listed in the actionItems array of the task details, then remove it from the response.

**Example Response:**

```json

  {
    "title": "Review project documentation",
    "completed": false

  {
    "title": "Schedule team meeting for next week",
    "completed": true
