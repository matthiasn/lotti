# Formal specs

TLA+ models of the protocols in this app that are too concurrent to trust to
prose, model-checked with TLC. A spec here describes the code as it is: a
change to the modelled code updates the spec in the same pull request, and CI
(`.github/workflows/tla-model-check.yml`) re-checks it whenever either moves.

## Running

```sh
make tla_check                      # every configuration
specs/tla/tlc.sh SyncSequenceCrash  # one configuration
```

`tlc.sh` needs Java 11 or newer (`JAVA=/path/to/java` if it is not on `PATH`).
It downloads the pinned `tla2tools.jar` once, verifies its SHA-256, and caches
it in `TLA_TOOLS_DIR` (default `~/.cache/lotti-tla`). A configuration
`<Spec><Variant>.cfg` checks `<Spec>.tla`.

## `SyncSequence` — the sync sequence log and backfill

One originating device and its peers: counter reservation, the payload write,
the outbox bind, releases and burns, startup reconciliation, backfill requests
and responses, and gap detection on the receivers. The mapping from each action
to the Dart code is in the spec's header; the protocol itself is described in
[Sequence log and backfill](../../knowledge/features/sync/sequence-and-backfill.md)
and the decision in [ADR 0065](../../docs/adr/0065-model-checked-sync-sequence-reservations.md).

| Property | Kind | Says |
|----------|------|------|
| `NoFalseBurn` | invariant | no device ever burns a counter whose payload committed |
| `ReceivedIsReal` | invariant | a peer's `received`/`backfilled` row is backed by that data or newer |
| `BoundRowsHavePayload` | invariant | the originator only answers from rows whose payload is on disk |
| `BurnedIsTerminal` | action | `burned` has no outgoing edge on any device |
| `EventuallyDelivered` | liveness | every committed write reaches every peer |
| `NoStuckRequest` | liveness | every backfill request is settled by the protocol, not by giving up |

| Configuration | Crashes | Faults | Unnamed reservations | Checks |
|---------------|---------|--------|----------------------|--------|
| `SyncSequence` | 0 | none | allowed | all |
| `SyncSequenceCrash` | 1, anywhere | none | no | all |
| `SyncSequenceCrashUnnamed` | 1, anywhere | none | allowed | safety |
| `SyncSequenceFaults` | 0 | any two of: reserved-row insert, bind, post-commit throw, enqueue, burn broadcast, event loss | no | safety |

All four pass with two entities, three counters and one peer — between 0.8 and
5.1 million distinct states each, a few minutes in total.

What the configurations deliberately leave out:

- **Delivery under faults.** A swallowed enqueue failure or an event a peer
  abandons for good is not retried, so `EventuallyDelivered` is only claimed
  without faults.
- **A failed reserved-row insert followed by a crash in the same write.** No
  row and no memory then name the payload, and a later request is answered as
  a burn. TLC finds this with one crash plus the `rowWrite` fault; ADR 0065
  explains why it is accepted rather than closed.
- **Unnamed reservations after a crash.** They cannot be settled, so a request
  for one stays open until the requester gives up — which is why
  `SyncSequenceCrashUnnamed` checks safety only.

## Changing a spec

Keep the header's action-to-code map current. When a change is meant to fix a
hole, first reproduce the hole: run the configuration against the spec of the
old behaviour and keep the counterexample for the pull request. After the fix,
check that the property fails again when the fix is mutated away — a property
that cannot fail proves nothing.
