# Formal specs

TLA+ models of the protocols in this app that are too concurrent to trust to
prose, model-checked with TLC. A spec here describes the code as it is: a
change to the modelled code updates the spec in the same pull request, and CI
(`.github/workflows/tla-model-check.yml`) re-checks it whenever either moves.

## Running

```sh
make tla_check                      # every configuration
specs/tla/tlc.sh SyncSequenceCrash  # one configuration
```

`tlc.sh` needs Java 11 or newer (`JAVA=/path/to/java` if it is not on `PATH`).
It downloads the pinned `tla2tools.jar` once, verifies its SHA-256, and caches
it in `TLA_TOOLS_DIR` (default `~/.cache/lotti-tla`). A configuration
`<Spec><Variant>.cfg` checks `<Spec>.tla`.

## `SyncSequence` — the sync sequence log and backfill

One originating device and its peers: counter reservation, the payload write,
the outbox bind, releases and burns, startup reconciliation, backfill requests
and responses, and gap detection on the receivers. The mapping from each action
to the Dart code is in the spec's header; the protocol itself is described in
[Sequence log and backfill](../../knowledge/features/sync/sequence-and-backfill.md)
and the decision in [ADR 0065](../../docs/adr/0065-model-checked-sync-sequence-reservations.md).

| Property | Kind | Says |
|----------|------|------|
| `NoFalseBurn` | invariant | no device ever burns a counter whose payload committed |
| `ReceivedIsReal` | invariant | a peer's `received`/`backfilled` row is backed by that data or newer |
| `BoundRowsHavePayload` | invariant | the originator only answers from rows whose payload is on disk |
| `BurnedIsTerminal` | action | `burned` has no outgoing edge on any device |
| `EventuallyDelivered` | liveness | every committed write reaches every peer |
| `NoStuckRequest` | liveness | every backfill request is settled by the protocol, not by giving up |

| Configuration | Crashes | Faults | Unnamed reservations | Checks |
|---------------|---------|--------|----------------------|--------|
| `SyncSequence` | 0 | none | allowed | all |
| `SyncSequenceCrash` | 1, anywhere | none | no | all |
| `SyncSequenceCrashUnnamed` | 1, anywhere | none | allowed | safety |
| `SyncSequenceCrashFault` | 1, anywhere | any one of the faults below | no | safety |
| `SyncSequenceFaults` | 0 | any two of: reserved-row insert (settings fallback taken), reserved-row insert and fallback both, bind, post-commit throw, enqueue, burn broadcast, event loss | no | safety |

All five pass with two entities, three counters and one peer — between 0.8 and
4.4 million distinct states each, a few minutes in total.

What the configurations deliberately leave out:

- **Delivery under faults.** A swallowed enqueue failure or an event a peer
  abandons for good is not retried, so `EventuallyDelivered` is only claimed
  without faults.
- **Unnamed reservations after a crash.** They cannot be settled, so a request
  for one stays open until the requester gives up — which is why
  `SyncSequenceCrashUnnamed` checks safety only.

## `OwnCounterSettlement` — recovery interleavings

This focused safety model expands the atomic settlement and fallback migration
in `SyncSequence`. It separates the sequence-row read, settings read, migration
insert/removal, durable enqueue and binding. An earlier answer in the same batch
may silently fail to enqueue, or enqueue version 2 before version 3 commits.

The configuration checks `TypeOK`, `NoFalseBurn` and `BoundHasQueuedPayload`
across 160 distinct states. It models one named, inactive reservation and two
payload versions. No write can still commit the requested counter after the
settlement reads start. Payload purges, unavailable stores, retries, peers and
crashes are outside this focused model; it claims safety, not delivery liveness.

Both guards have mutation switches. In a temporary copy of the configuration,
set one switch to `FALSE` and run TLC against `OwnCounterSettlement.tla`:

| Mutation | Expected counterexample |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `RecheckSequence = FALSE` | `NoFalseBurn`: the first row read misses, migration inserts the row and removes the settings fallback, the second read misses, settlement burns the committed counter |
| `RequireDurableEnqueue = FALSE` | `BoundHasQueuedPayload`: an earlier batch answer attempts a resend, its enqueue fails (or queues an older version), settlement skips its own enqueue and binds |

Keep mutation configurations outside this directory: CI runs every checked-in
configuration and expects each to pass. The handler suite has deterministic
regressions for both races, newer payload versions, migrated unnamed/already
settled rows, and a failed sequence-log recheck. Reverting the Dart guards makes
all six new regressions fail.

## From the model to the code

TLC checks the design, not the Dart that implements it. The gap is narrowed by
a generated conformance test,
`test/features/sync/backfill/backfill_response_handler_model_conformance.dart`
(a part of the handler's suite). It drives the real `VectorClockService`,
sequence log and `BackfillResponseHandler` over in-memory databases through
Glados-generated traces of reservations, commits, outbox binds, releases,
crashes (a fresh service stack over the same stores), backfill requests and
outbox outages, and checks `NoFalseBurn`, `BoundRowsHavePayload` and
`BurnedIsTerminal` after every step, and after a final restart, that every
committed write was bound and actually reached the outbox. Reverting the
settlement fix, or binding before the resend is durably queued, makes it fail
with a shrunk trace of four or five steps.

## Changing a spec

Keep the header's action-to-code map current. When a change is meant to fix a
hole, first reproduce the hole: run the configuration against the spec of the
old behaviour and keep the counterexample for the pull request. After the fix,
check that the property fails again when the fix is mutated away — a property
that cannot fail proves nothing.
