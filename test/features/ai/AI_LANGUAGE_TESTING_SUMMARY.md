## UI Testing

### 1. Language Selection Modal Content Test

**Status:** ✅ All tests passing

Tests covered:
- ✅ Displays all supported languages
- ✅ Filters languages by search query
- ✅ Filters languages by language code
- ✅ Callback is called when language is selected
- ✅ Displays selected language at the top
- ✅ Displays clear option when language is selected
- ✅ Clear option removes language selection
- ✅ Search field has correct placeholder

### 2. Task Language Widget Test
**File:** `test/features/tasks/ui/header/task_language_widget_test.dart`
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing

Tests covered:
- ✅ Displays language placeholder when no language is set
- ✅ Displays country flag when language is set
- ✅ Opens language selector modal on tap
- ✅ Passes initial language to modal
- ✅ Calls callback when language is selected
- ✅ Modal closes after language selection
- ✅ Flag has correct size and styling
- ✅ Flag container provides visibility in dark mode

## Integration Points

The language feature integrates with:

1. **Task Data Model**
   - Added optional `languageCode` field to TaskData
   - Field is properly serialized/deserialized

2. **AI Function Calling**
   - TaskFunctions provides `set_task_language` tool
   - AI can detect and set language based on content analysis
   - Language detection includes confidence level and reasoning

3. **AI Input Repository**
   - Includes languageCode in task context for AI
   - Includes transcript languages from audio entries
   - Passes language information to AI for summary generation

4. **AI Inference**
   - System message is modified to include language preference
   - AI generates summaries in the detected/selected language
   - Existing language preferences are not overridden

## Test Coverage Assessment

### Well Tested ✅
- Task data model with language support
- UI components (widget and modal)
- Task functions schema and data structures
- AI input repository language handling

### Needs Additional Testing 🟨
- End-to-end integration test for language detection workflow
- Language detection accuracy with mixed-language content

### Recommended Additional Tests 📝
1. Integration test: User records audio → AI detects language → Summary generated in that language
2. Edge cases: Multiple languages in same task, language conflicts
3. Performance: Language detection with large amounts of content
4. Localization: UI elements properly translated for all supported languages
